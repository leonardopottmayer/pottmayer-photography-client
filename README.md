# Leonardo Pottmayer - Pottmayer Photography

Album de fotos [LINK](https://photography.pottmayer.dev).

## Descrição

Um dos meus hobbys é fazer fotos, tenho uma conta no instagram específica para postá-las (@pottmayer.photography).
Sempre quis aprender a manipular fotos com aplicações web e ter outro lugar para guardá-las além do instagram, por isso
resolvi criar esta aplicação.
Basicamente para os usuários comuns existe apenas a rota principal que mostra todas as fotos. E existe a área de admin, onde é possível
criar novas postagens e vincular imagens a elas, editar postagens ou excluí-las.

Neste projeto utilizei React.js para frontend, MongoDB como banco de dados, uma API node/express para o backend e utilizei os serviços
da S3, que pertencem à AWS Amazon para guardar as imagens.

Por motivos de segurança a rota de registro está desabilitada, pois não posso fornecer acesso e poder de edição ou deleção para
os arquivos ali guardados.

Abaixo você encontra as instruções padrão para rodar a aplicação React.js.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
